ingredientTags:
  - bourbon
  - coffee liqueur
  - orange bitters
  - angostura bitters
ingredients:
  - 2 ounces bourbon, preferably Bulleit
  - ½ ounce coffee liqueur
  - 2 dashes orange bitters
  - Flamed orange peel
recipe: |
  Stir all of the ingredients in a mixing glass filled with ice, strain into a chilled coupe glass. Flame an orange peel over the drink (see notes).
notes: |
  To flame an orange peel, use a paring knife to cut a silver-dollar sized tangent circle off an orange. Light a wooden match and hover it several inches above the cocktail at a 45°angle. Sharply squeeze the pith-side of the peel a few inches from the flames so the essential oils spray from the rind to create a quick flashpoint over the cocktail. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc6WEdQjZiQ) demonstrates the technique.
