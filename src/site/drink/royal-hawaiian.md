  - ¾ ounce orgeat
recipe: |
  Combine all ingredients in a shaking tin with ice. Shake and strain into a chilled coupe glass.
notes: |
  The internet disagrees about whether to do ¾ ounce orgeat or ½ ounce orgeat. I have only tried it with ½ ounce orgeat. If you make this with more orega, give me a taste!

  This drink is also good served over ice or with sode water. Garnish with fresh mint!
