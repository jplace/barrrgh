title: Whiskey Sour
ingredientTags:
  - bourbon
  - rye
  - egg white
  - lemon juice
  - simple syrup
ingredients:
  - 2 ounces bourbon or rye
  - ¾ ounce lemon juice
  - ¾ ounce simple syrup
  - 1 egg white
  - Orange slice, cherry, and/or Angostura bitters (for garnish)
recipe: |
  Fill shaker with ice and all ingredients. Shake and serve in coupe glass. Add any or all garnishes suggested.
notes: |
  Some people claim you should "dry shake" the ingredients with no ice, so the egg will foam without the moisture from melting ice. I've found that if you use our bigger ice cubes, everything can just be vigorously shaken together.

  I've also seen people say you can substitute ¾ ounce aquafaba (from a can of chickpeas). I'm interested.
