ingredients:
  - 2¼ ounces London dry gin
  - ¾ ounce dry vermouth
  - 1 dash orange bitters
  - Lemon twist or olives (for garnish)
recipe: |
  Stir all liquid ingredients in a mixing glass chocked full of ice. Strain into a martini glass and garnish with lemon twist or olives.
notes: |
  A 50/50 martini can be made by using equal amounts gin and vermouth.

  In an older version of this recipe, I suggested shaking the heck out of the martini. I've since heard and verified in a blind taste test that shaking disrupts the flavor of the gin. Stir your gin martinis!
